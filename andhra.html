              makes it is even more attractive to the devotees. The idea for
              this temple germinated in the year of 1974 – 1975, when his holy
              Srila Prabhupada visited Tirumala- Tirupati on the request of
              Andhra Pradesh Government. Impressed with the spiritual atmosphere
              of the place and after seeing thousands of devotees visiting every
              day, he saw this Tirupathi as an ideal place to promote the
              teachings of Bhagwat-Gita and Lord Krishna while in turn creating
              an environment of amity throughout the world.

              Tirupati Akasha Ganga is a sacred waterfall and holy teertham
              located in the Seshagiri hills, about 3 to 5 km from the Tirumala
              Temple. Believed to originate from Lord Vishnu's or Lord
              Venkateswara's lotus feet, its holy waters are used for all
              rituals, including the abhishekam (bathing) of the main deity at
              the Tirumala temple. The site is considered very sacred and is a
              beautiful, relaxing place to visit, with water flowing year-round.
              You can reach Akasha Ganga by APSRTC bus and taxi services from
              Tirupati. A short trek of 5-10 minutes is required to reach the
              waterfall. You can experience the beauty of the waterfall, but
              sometimes the pathway to the foot of the waterfall may be closed,
              allowing you to only see it from the temple vicinity.
