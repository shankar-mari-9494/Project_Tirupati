                Charminar was built by Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah in 1591. It is said that this square shaped structure with four pillars and intricate carvings was built in honour of his wife, Bhagmati. However, the actual reason behind building Charminar is still not clear. <br>
            As per a popular belief, Charminar was built to acknowledge the elimination of the plague which had affected the entire city immensely during that era. It is believed that the Sultan had prayed for the end of this plague with which his people were suffering. <br> Hence, as the plague ended, he built the charminar as a tribute to Allah. The four pillars are also said to be dedicated to the first four caliphs of Islam <br>
            In the middle of the Charminar courtyard, you will find a small vazu with a small fountain, which has been built to provide water for the ablution before offering prayers.

            The term "Golconda"can be broken down into two word "Golla" and "Konda" which literally translate into "Shepherds hill" in Telugu. <br>
            Hidden in these words ,lie the legend of the origin of this fort.One fine day ,a shepherd boy came across an idol on this hill and informed the Kakatiya Kng about it. <br>
            The King considering it to be a sacred site got a mud fort constructed here,This was the initial structure of the fort before the grand edifice came into existence. <br>
            The Golconda fort is believe to have built by the kakatiyas in the 13th century CE,The Structure was reinforced by Pratapa Rudra (r. 1289-1323),one of the most prominent Kakatiya rulers and the last King of the dynasty.
